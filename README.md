I have written a macro that will open a webpage, find the spots I need to put the data into, and then I want the macro to hit a prefill button, then hit Ok.

The page source code for the button is:

<input type="text" size="30" maxlength="40" name="name" id="name">
<input type="button" value="Prefill" onclick="prefill()">
I've been searching for answers all week and I think I have a basic understanding of how this is supposed to work by running a loop to search for it, but I'm having no luck in my endeavor of actually getting this to work.

Can someone show me the loop that will search my page for this button?

Thank you in advance.

Requested code so far

Tags provide a useful way to group related posts together and to quickly tell readers what a post is about. Tags also make it easier for people to find your content. Tags are similar to, but more specific than, categories. The use of tags is completely optional.

For more information on the differences between tags and categories please check out this support doc.

Depending on the theme and widgets you have activated, tags can be displayed at the top or bottom of posts, on the individual post view, and/or in the sidebar. You can assign multiple tags per post.

Adding Tags via the Tags Module

You can assign and/or add new tags to posts before you publish them using the Categories & Tags module to the bottom left of the post editor:

yOU CAN TELL A COMPUTER WHAT ITEMS ARE IN A LIST<LI> ('ITEM LIST) BEFORE AND </LI> AFTER EACH ITEM.
